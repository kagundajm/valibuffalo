# ValiBuffalo

ValiBuffalo demonstrates how you can use [vali-admin dashboard template](https://pratikborsadiya.in/vali-admin/) in a [Buffalo](https://gobuffalo.io/en) application. A tutorial on how to add the template to the project can be located at 

## Getting Started

Clone or download the repo. Edit the urls in the `database.yml` file to match the location of where you downloaded the app. Then run:
```
$ buffalo setup
$ buffalo dev
```

If you now visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser, you should see the app.

Good luck!
